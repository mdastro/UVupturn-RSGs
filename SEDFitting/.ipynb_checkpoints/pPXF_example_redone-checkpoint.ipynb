    "### MODIFICATION HISTORY:\n",
    "* **V1.0.0**: Adapted from PPXF_KINEMATICS_EXAMPLE. Michele Cappellari, Oxford, 12 October 2011\n",

    "* **V1.1.1**: Includes `regul_error` definition. MC, Oxford, 15 November 2012\n",
    "* **V2.0.0**: Translated from IDL into Python. MC, Oxford, 6 December 2013\n",
    "* **V2.0.1**: Fit SDSS rather than SAURON spectrum. MC, Oxford, 11 December 2013\n",
    "* **V2.1.0**: Includes gas emission as templates instead of masking the spectrum. MC, Oxford, 7 January 2014\n",
    "* **V2.1.1**: Support both Python 2.6/2.7 and Python 3.x. MC, Oxford, 25 May 2014\n",

    "* **V2.1.3**: Only includes emission lines falling within the fitted wavelength range. MC, Oxford, 3 September 2014\n",
    "* **V2.1.4**: Explicitly sort template files as `glob()` output may not be sorted. Thanks to Marina Trevisan for reporting problems under Linux. MC, Sydney, 4 February 2015\n",

    "* **V3.0.0**: Major upgrade. Compute mass-weighted population parameters and $M/L$ using the new *miles* class which leaves no room for user mistakes. MC, Oxford, 2 December 2016\n",
    "* **V3.0.1**: Make files paths relative to this file, to run the example from any directory. MC, Oxford, 18 January 2017\n",
    "* **V3.1.0**: Use ppxf method `pp.plot(gas_component=...)` to produce gas emission lines plot. MC, Oxford, 13 March 2017\n",
    "* **V3.2.0**: Uses new ppxf keywords `gas_component` and `gas_names` to print the fluxes and formal errors for the gas emission lines. Uses different kinematic components for the Balmer lines and the rest. MC, Oxford, 28 June 2017\n",
    "* **V3.3.0**: Illustrate how to tie the Balmer emission lines and fit for the gas reddening using the `tie_balmer` keyword. Also limit doublets. MC, Oxford, 31 October 2017\n",
    "* **V3.3.1**: Changed imports for pPXF as a package. Make file paths relative to the pPXF package to be able to run the example unchanged from any directory. MC, Oxford, 17 April 2018\n",
    "* **V3.3.2**: Dropped legacy Python 2.7 support. MC, Oxford, 10 May 2018 "
